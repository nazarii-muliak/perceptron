# Perceptron Simulator

![Perceptron Demo](./Preview.png)

## Overview

This project is a simple and interactive visual representation of a **perceptron**, designed as a teaching tool for students learning about the basics of neural networks and machine learning. The simulator demonstrates how a perceptron processes inputs, applies weights, and produces an output in a user-friendly and visual way.

## Features

* üñ•Ô∏è **Interactive Switches**: Toggle inputs on and off to simulate binary inputs to the perceptron.
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Adjustable Weights**: Set weights for each input to see their effect on the output.
* üìà **Real-time Output**: Watch the perceptron‚Äôs output update in real time, displayed on an analog gauge.
* üé® **Clean Visuals**: A wooden-texture inspired UI for an engaging, tangible feel.

## Technologies Used

* JavaScript / HTML / CSS / JQuery


## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nazarii-muliak/perceptron.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd perceptron
```

Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

### Usage

1. Toggle the input switches to activate/deactivate inputs.
2. Adjust the weights using the knobs.
3. Observe how the output gauge changes based on the inputs and weights.

## Educational Goals

This project is intended to:

* Help students **visualize the core concepts** of a perceptron.
* Provide an **interactive way to experiment** with neural network parameters.
* Make the learning experience **more engaging** and intuitive.
